# SongTest
A test playground for soundsplitting

July 16th - Current version opens up to an activity with buttons to play a song (added by whoever pulls, as of now we need
to figure out DRM info, which I believe has to do with copyrighting and whatnot).  The buttons can play and pause the song
as well as adjust the left and right channel volumes separately. There is a button to equalize the volumes and one to focus
on each ear @ 100%.
